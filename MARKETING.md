### Video 1: "The Saver" (60 seconds)

**Hook** (0-3 sec):

```

**Problem** (3-8 sec):
```
"Seller said it's worth $300+
But I had a feeling something was off"
```

**Solution** (8-15 sec):
```
[Screen record texting link to ThriftTok]
"So I texted it to ThriftTok"
```

**Proof** (15-45 sec):
```
[Show response]
"VALUE: $10-15
PROFIT: -$185 (LOSS)
CONDITION: Reproduction, not vintage
VERDICT: PASS
WHY: Modern replica with fake tags"

"Saved me $185 in 60 seconds"
```

**CTA** (45-60 sec):

## 📘 Facebook Groups (Secondary Channel)

### Target Groups

**Join these** (10 min total):
1. "Facebook Marketplace Resellers" (50k+ members)
2. "Thrift Store Flippers" (30k+ members)
3. "eBay Resellers Community"
4. "Poshmark Sellers"
5. "[Your City] Buy/Sell/Trade"
6. "Side Hustle Ideas & Tips"

### Post Template

**Title**: Tool for fellow resellers - instant Marketplace analysis

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone 👋

I built a tool that's saved me SO much money.

You text any Facebook Marketplace link to a number, and it tells you:
• Estimated resale value (based on eBay sold comps)
• Profit potential after fees
• Condition red flags to look for
• Buy/negotiate/pass recommendation

$2 per check. Results in ~60 seconds. No app needed.

Examples from this week:
✅ "Vintage" jacket ($150 asking) → Analysis: $10-15 value, modern replica → SAVED $135
✅ Nike hoodie ($15 asking) → Analysis: $45-65 value → Bought it, sold for $58 → PROFIT $43
❌ "Rare" sneakers ($200 asking) → Analysis: $40-60 value → SAVED $140

It's basically paying $2 to avoid $100+ mistakes.

Text any Marketplace link to: [YOUR NUMBER]

Not affiliated with FB/Meta, just a side project that works.

Anyone else using AI tools for reselling?
```

**Why This Works**:
- Leads with value, not selling
- Social proof via examples
- Clear ROI ($2 to save $100+)
- Asks question at end (engagement)

**Rules**:
- ✅ Post once per group (don't spam)
- ✅ Engage with comments
- ✅ Be helpful, not salesy
- ❌ Don't cross-post same text (vary it slightly)

## 🔴 Reddit Strategy (Tertiary Channel)

### Target Subreddits

1. **r/Flipping** (200k members)
   - Flair: "Tools & Resources"
   - Title: "[Tool] SMS-based Marketplace analyzer - $2 per check"

2. **r/ThriftStoreHauls** (1.8M members)
   - Flair: "Tip"
   - Title: "PSA: Check before you buy - saved me $500 this month"

3. **r/SideHustle** (500k members)
   - Flair: "Resource"
   - Title: "Built an AI tool for resellers ($2/check) - making $50/day"

### Reddit Post Template

**For r/Flipping**:
```
**[Tool] SMS-based Marketplace analyzer**

Built this for myself after buying too much junk on FB Marketplace.

How it works:
• Text any Marketplace link to [number]
• Get instant analysis:
  - Estimated value (based on eBay sold comps)
  - Profit potential
  - Buy/pass/negotiate recommendation
• $2 per check

No app, no signup. Results in ~60 seconds.

Examples:
- Saved me from a fake vintage jacket ($150 asking, worth $10)
- Found a underpriced Nike hoodie ($15 asking, sold for $58)

Basically paying $2 to avoid $100 mistakes.

Not asking for feedback, just sharing since it's been useful for me. Happy to answer questions.

Text [number] if you want to try it.
```

**Why This Template Works**:
- Not overly promotional
- Leads with utility
- Concrete examples
- "Not asking for feedback" = reverse psychology

**Reddit Rules**:
- ✅ Engage genuinely in comments
- ✅ Provide value in the post
- ✅ Don't delete if downvoted initially
- ❌ Don't spam multiple subreddits same day
- ❌ Don't argue with skeptics
